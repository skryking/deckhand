# Deckhand
This application is a stupid captains log app for playing star citizen that I have completely vibe coded with Claude code while on my 
spare time. The code sucks and I don't know if anyone should actually use it.  I've done no verification of the code, no security testing, and I don't really have any idea if its going to blow up your system or not.  It works on my computer in windows 11. Thats about all I can say about it.  Use it for what you will.  I'll probably keep vibe coding changes to it as I go along and need something added. Some features exist and some don't.  Again this is just for my personal use to keep track of my time in the game.

there are [release builds](https://github.com/skryking/deckhand/tags) if you don't feel like building it yourself... as always this is badly vibe coded and I was probably having a beer at the time as well.
